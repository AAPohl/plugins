# OpenWeatherMap

This plugins can be used retrieve weather information from OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/).

## Support
Support is provided trough the support thread within the smarthomeNG forum: [Smarthome.py](https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/supportforen/smarthome-py)


### Requirements

An api key from OpenWeatherMap is needed. It can be obtained free of charge from ```https://openweathermap.org```.

The api key which is available free of charge allows up to 60 calls a minute. Keep this in mind if you want to change the update frequency using the **`cycle`** parameter.

## Configuration

### plugin.yaml

Use the plugin configuration to configure the openweathermap plugin.

```yaml
# for etc/plugin.yaml configuration file:
weather_openweathermap:
    plugin_name: openweathermap
    key: xxxxyyyyxxxxyyyy
    instance: 'home'
    # latitude: '48.04712'
    # longitude: '11.81421'
    # altitude: '100'
    # lang: 'de'
    # cycle: 600
```

The API-key is configured via the **`key`** parameter.

You can configure multiple instances of the openweathermap plugin to collect data for multiple locations. If you don't need multiple locations / instances you may omit the **`instance`**-definition.

Positional information is optional and if it is omitted, the position-data from the **`etc/smarthome.yaml`** is considered.

The language for the responses is defined in the **`lang`** parameter.

The api key which is available free of charge allows up to 60 calls a minute. Keep this in mind if you want to change the update frequency using the **`cycle`** parameter. Keep in mind that this plugin uses multiple calls per update-cycle. It may sum up to 10 calls per cycle. If you use the same API-key in SmartVisu, this will as well consume your call-quota.

### items.yaml / Mapping of OWM-data to SHNG-items

The data provided by OpenWeatherMap is mapped to items by matchstrings. A matchstring is defining the path to a data-source within an API-response field. The available resources make use of the following APIs:

- [weather](https://openweathermap.org/current)
- [forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
- ~~[uvi](https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi)~~ *deprecated*
- [onecall](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
- onecall-0...onecall-4 uses the time-machine feature provided by the [one-call-api](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#history), to collect the "historic" data, which includes past values of today (onecall-0).
- [layer](https://openweathermap.org/api/weathermaps), providing map tile-data.

The list before is providing the names of the "data-source-keys" that are used within this plugin. You can see the results of the last calls within the web-interface of this plugin. The plugin identifies the need for downloading data from each endpoint by the definition of the respective matchstring. If no matchstring would require data from e.g. the data-source "weather", then this endpoint would not be called by the plugin. The prefferable way of reading weather-data is via the one-call API.

Data is retrieved in metric units (m, mm, hPa, Â°C).

#### Soft-failing matching

The typical matching would access the root of the JSON-response of an API call and then follow the provided path to select the items from the response "tree". If the next node along the path cannot be matched an ERROR will be logged. Typically this is caused by typos or missing / wrong integer-indices on counted items.

Unfortunately not all responses from OWM will always contain a value. For example rain or snow data is only included if rain or snow has actually fallen or will be falling. For matchstrings ending in 'snow/3h', 'snow/1h', 'rain/3h' or 'rain/1h' an unmatched item will receive the value 0 instead of None. This will be logged as a DEBUG-level message (if enabled).

#### Matchstring-Rewriting / Data-Source identification

Matchstrings are re-written by the plugin to allow a clear distinction of the data-sources while maintaining readability. The start of a matchstring provides a hint on the utilized data-source:

- **begins with "virtual/"**, see [Virtual matchstrings](#virtual-matchstrings)
  example: `virtual/past24h/sum/rain/1h` for the total amount of rain in the past 24h.
- **begins with "forecast/daily/"**, see [Daily forecast (calculated)](#daily-forecast-calculated)
  example: `forecast/daily/0/main/temp_min` for tomorrows minimal temperature.
  consider using the one-call equivalents, e.g. `day/1/temp/min` to retrieve the same value as in the example
- **ends with "/eto" and begins with "current/" or "daily/"**, see [Evapotranspiration](#evapotranspiration)
  example: `daily/1/eto` for tomorrows ETO-value.
- **begins with "forecast/"** original data-source is the [forecast-API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#JSON):
  the prefix "forecast/" is replaced with "list/" when matching items in the JSON-source.
  example: `forecast/1/main/humidity` to retrieve the forecasted humidity three hours in the future.
- **begins with "uvi_"** original data-source is the [uvi-API](https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi#JSON):
  the prefix "uvi_" is removed when matching items in the JSON-source.
  example: `uvi_value` to get the current UV-index value
  as this API is deprecated, the replacement is `current/uvi`, it may be automatically replaced in future versions of this plugin.
- **begins with "current/"** original data-source is the [onecall-API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), values are read directly.
  example: `current/weather/description` for a text describing the current weather in the defined language.
- **begins with "hour/I/"** where I is a number between 0 and 47 representing the relative hour from now onwards. Original data-source is the [onecall-API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
  the prefix "hour/" is replaced with "hourly/" when matching items in the JSON-source.
  example: `hour/2/feels_like` to get the perceived temperature two hours from now.
  complete set of data-points that can be retrieved for each hour:
    - `dt`: Point in time represented by this data-point
    - `temp`: Temperature in Celsius
    - `feels_like`: Perceived Temperature
    - `pressure`: Atmospheric pressure on the sea level, hPa
    - `humidity`: Relative Humidity in %
    - `dew_point`: Atmospheric temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense and dew can form. Celsius
    - `uvi`: UV index
    - `clouds`: Cloudiness %
    - `rain/1h`: Rain volume in mm
    - `snow/1h`: Snow volume in mm
    - `visibility`: Average visibility, metres
    - `wind_speed`: Wind speed in metre/sec
    - `wind_deg`: Wind direction, degrees (meteorological)
    - `wind_gust`: Wind gust (peaks in speed) in metre/sec
    - `weather/0/id`: to get the weather condition id
    - `weather/0/main`: to get the group-name of weather parameters (Rain, Snow, Extreme etc.)
    - `weather/0/description`: to get the weather condition description within the group.
    - `weather/0/icon`: to get the weather icon id
    - `pop`: Propability of precipitation
- **begins with "day/N/"** where N is a number between 0 and 6. Be aware that -0 (see below) and 0 are returning different valid values! Original data-source is the [onecall-API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).
  As you are using a positive value for N (including 0) outlook data is retrieved.
  the prefix "day/" is replaced with "daily/" when matching items in the JSON-source.
  example: `day/1/feels_like/night` to get tomorrows perceived temperature at night.
  complete set of data-points that can be retrieved for each day:
    - `dt`: Point in time represented by this data-point
    - `sunrise`: Sunrise of this day, UTC
    - `sunset`: Sunset of this day, UTC
    - `moonrise`: Moonrise of this day, UTC
    - `moonset`: Moonset of this day, UTC
    - `temp/morn`:  Morning temperature in Celsius.
    - `temp/day`:  Day temperature in Celsius.
    - `temp/eve`:  Evening temperature in Celsius.
    - `temp/night`:  Night temperature in Celsius.
    - `temp/min`:  Min daily temperature in Celsius.
    - `temp/max`:  Max daily temperature in Celsius.
    - `feels_like/morn`: Perceived Morning Temperature
    - `feels_like/day`: Perceived Day Temperature
    - `feels_like/eve`: Perceived Evening Temperature
    - `feels_like/night`: Perceived Night Temperature
    - `pressure`: Atmospheric pressure on the sea level, hPa
    - `humidity`: Relative Humidity in %
    - `dew_point`: Atmospheric temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense and dew can form. Celsius
    - `uvi`: Maximum UV index for the day
    - `clouds`: Cloudiness %
    - `rain`: Rain volume in mm
    - `snow`: Snow volume in mm
    - `pop`: Propability of precipitation
    - `visibility`: Average visibility, metres
    - `wind_speed`: Wind speed in metre/sec
    - `wind_deg`: Wind direction, degrees (meteorological)
    - `wind_gust`: Wind gust (peaks in speed) in metre/sec
    - `weather/0/id`: to get the weather condition id
    - `weather/0/main`: to get the group-name of weather parameters (Rain, Snow, Extreme etc.)
    - `weather/0/description`: to get the weather condition description within the group.
    - `weather/0/icon`: to get the weather icon id
- **begins with "day/-N/"** where N is a number between 0 and 4. Be aware that -0 and 0 (see above) are returning different valid values! Original data-source is the [onecall-API with the time-machine feature](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#history).
  As you are using a negative value for N (including -0) historic data is retrieved. Appending an "hour/I/" to the matchstring results in selecting an hour "I" of that particular day. Warning: Accessing "day/-0/hour/18/..." at an earlier time than 6pm (UTC!!) will result in an ERROR as the API is not combining historic data with outlook data.
  Without appending hour, the daily summary will be retrieved (from the tree below "current/" within the JSON response).
  examples: 
    - `day/-1/hour/13/temp` to get yesterdays temperature at 1pm UTC.
    - `day/-2/pressure` to get the average(?) air-pressure from the day before yesterday.
- **ends with _new (see list below)** prepares a map-layer URL either from the given parameters owm_coord_x, owm_coord_y, owm_coord_z or from a translation of the current geo-coordinates to the tile-information
  Complete list of map-layers:
  - `clouds_new`
  - `precipitation_new`
  - `pressure_new`
  - `wind_new`
  - `temp_new`
- **everything else** is tried to be matched against the [weather-API](https://openweathermap.org/current).
  Complete list:
    - `base` / `cod` / `sys/id` / `sys/type` to get some internal parameters (if you can make sense of it).
    - `coord/lon` / `coord/lat` / `id` / `name` / `sys/country` / `timezone` for OWM's interpretation of your location data.
    - `clouds/all` / `visibility` to get the current cloud coverage and visibility range in meters.
    - `dt` / `sys/sunrise` / `sys/sunset` to get the request's time, sunrise and sunset time in UTC.
    - `main/temp` / `main/feels_like` / `main/temp_max` / `main/temp_min` to get current / today's temperature data.
    - `rain/1h` / `rain/3h` / `snow/1h` / `snow/3h` to get current precipitation data in mm
    - `main/humidity` / `main/pressure` to get current relative humidity (in %) and pressure values
    - `weather/0/id` to get the weather condition id
    - `weather/0/main` to get the group-name of weather parameters (Rain, Snow, Extreme etc.)
    - `weather/0/description` to get the weather condition description within the group.
    - `weather/0/icon` to get the weather icon id
    - `wind/deg` / `wind/speed` / `wind/gust` to get some facts about the wind (direction/speed/peak-speeds)


#### Virtual matchstrings

Not all data can be directly retrieved via any API, some data needs to be aggregated via multiple data-sources. If you want to know the amount of rain of the past 24 hours at 10am you would need to query todays and yesterdays data and then summarize the data. This feature is built into the plugin. Virtual matchstrings are prefixed with the keyword "virtual".

```yaml

owm:
    rain_past_24h:
        type: num
        owm_matchstring@home: virtual/past24h/sum/rain/1h
    rain_next_24h:
        type: num
        owm_matchstring@home: virtual/next24h/sum/rain/1h
    avg_wind_next_24h:
        type: num
        owm_matchstring@home: virtual/next24h/avg/wind_speed
    max_wind_next_12h:
        type: num
        owm_matchstring@home: virtual/next12h/max/wind_gust

```

The virtual matchstrings consist of the following elements:

- prefix "virtual"
- a time-frame that could be:
    - past12h
    - next12h
    - past24h
    - next24h
- an aggregation-function:
    - sum
    - max
    - min
    - avg
- a matchstring that would match an element in the [hourly one-call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#example)


#### Daily forecast (calculated)

Another type of virtual matchstrings are the values selected by a "forecast/daily/N/..."-matchstring. N represents a value between 0 and 4, where 0 represents tomorrow, 1 the day after tomorrow, etc.
Here the [forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#JSON)-data source is used. You may suffix "/min" or "/max" to the match-string in order to retrieve the respective aggregation. By default the average value is returned.

```yaml

owm:
    home:
        forecast_daily0:
            temp:
                type: num
                owm_matchstring@home: forecast/daily/0/main/temp

            temp_min:
                type: num
                owm_matchstring@home: forecast/daily/0/main/temp_min/min

            temp_max:
                type: num
                owm_matchstring@home: forecast/daily/0/main/temp_max/max
```

#### Evapotranspiration

The Evapotranspiration considers effects like wind, solar radiation (even indirect on cloudy days), pressure and relative humidity to calculate the loss of water from the ground by evaporation. The original data-source for the components considered is the [one-call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#example). The resulting value is a demand for irrigation in mm. This can be set in relation with the fallen rain to identify the real need.

Examples for matchstrings:
- `current/eto` / `daily/0/eto` get today's ETO
- `daily/1/eto`

More information can be retrieved at the original implementation found here: (https://github.com/MTry/homebridge-smart-irrigation)

The implementation of the calculation is based on: (https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/ae/ae45900.pdf) and explained here: (http://www.fao.org/3/X0490E/x0490e00.htm#Contents)

Caveat: The formula used for ETO calculation makes use of a solar radiation feature. Unfortunately this value is not available for free via API. Luckily the UV-index matches the scale and should be somewhat equivalent to the actual value, so this is used in the calculation instead. Still: The usage of the UV-index instead of a real solar radiation feature is scientifically WRONG.

#### Struct to support irrigation control

You can use the irrigation struct to switch an irrigation valve (solenoid) off automatically, based on the daily watering demand. If you combine that with an uzsu you will be able to even start the irrigation automatically. Using this method you will be able to water your plant based on the demand and not perform irrigation if there was enough rain.

```yaml
garden:
    gut_feeling_for_irrigation:
        type: num
        cache: yes
        remark: Value ranging from 0 to 2 where 1 would be normal, and 2 would double the amount
    irrigation_valve1:
        knx_dpt: 1
        knx_send: ...
        knx_cache: ...
        struct: 
            - owm.irrigation
            - uzsu.child  # in case you want to start automatically
        evaporation:
            exposure_factor:
                initial_value: 0.9  # Lightly shady area (greenhouses could be 0.7)
        rain:
            exposure_factor:
                initial_value: 0.5  # half covered by a roof (greenhouses would be 0)
        factors:
            flowrate_l_per_min:
                initial_value: 3.8  # liters per minute by irrigation system
            area_in_sqm:
                initial_value: 6  # area covered by irrigation system
            crop_coefficient:
                initial_value: 0.9  # depends on the type of crop, typically 0.3 to 0.9
            plant_density:
                initial_value: 1  # are your plants planted close (1.5) or wide apart (0.3), typically 0.3 to 1.5
            gut_feeling:
                eval: sum
                eval_trigger:

#### Caveats

* All times are in UTC. So if you query "yesterdays" values for Germany you will have a 1hr or 2hr time-frame from the next day and a missing time-frame of the same day.
* The formula used for ETO calculation makes use of a solar radiation feature. Unfortunately this value is not available for free via API. Luckily the UV-index matches the scale and should be somewhat equivalent to the actual value, so this is used in the calculation instead. Still: The usage of the UV-index instead of a real solar radiation feature is scientifically WRONG.
* For an unknown reason ([Thanks for discovering Sisamiwe](https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/supportforen/smarthome-py/1246998-support-thread-zum-openweathermap-plugin?p=1672747#post1672747)) "weather" is a list, so you have to use "weather/0/id" to get the id value.

#### Tips and Tricks

To convert the time in the dt values to a local value you may want to use an eval string and generate a printable value.

  ```yaml
